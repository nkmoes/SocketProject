3. setup-ring <n> <user-name>      *just need to set up sockets (not orientation or election)
where n >= 3 is an odd integer. This command initiates the construction
of a ring of size n by the named user. In this project, while multiple rings may exist at any time, each user may
only participate in one ring at a time.
This command results in a return code of FAILURE if:
 - The user-name is not registered or is not Free.
 - n !>= 3 or is not odd.
 - There are not at least n > 1 other Free users, besides user-name, registered with the server.

Otherwise, the server selects at random n-1 Free users and updates each oneâ€™s state to InRing including
that of user-name. Because you need to support the existence of multiple O-RINGS, assign an identifier for
each ring set up.
The server returns a return code of SUCCESS, a ring-id, the ring size n, and a list of n users that together
will form the O-RING to user-name. The n users are given by tuples consisting of, at a minimum, for each
user its user-name, IPv4-address, two port(s) for communication in an O-RING, with the tuple of
user-name listed first. Receipt of SUCCESS at user-name involves several additional steps to accomplish
the setup of the O-RING. These steps which include ring orientation and leader election are described in x3.1.
